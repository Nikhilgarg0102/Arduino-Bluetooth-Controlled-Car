Bluetooth-Controlled Arduino Truck

1. Designed and developed an Arduino-based robotic truck controlled wirelessly through a mobile application using the HC-05 Bluetooth module.

2. Implemented serial communication (UART) to receive real-time control commands from the mobile device and translate them into motor actions.

3. Integrated a motor driver (L298N/L293D) to control DC motors, enabling smooth forward, reverse, left, and right movements with proper motor synchronization.

4. Developed embedded logic in Embedded C/C++ for efficient motor control, direction handling, and command validation.

5. Designed a battery-powered system, ensuring stable power delivery and safe operation of motors and control circuitry.

6. Gained hands-on experience in embedded systems, robotics, wireless communication, and hardware–software integration, with scope for future upgrades such as sensors or autonomous navigation.
